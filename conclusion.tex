\chapter{Conclusion}

Thanks to my job in Rainmaker Labs, I came to understand the development procedure, from scratch to finish. I was able to make acquaintance with SCRUM method. I had chances to aplly my university's knowledge, such as algorithm, design pattern, and for that reason, I actually could understand them more than before. I also could analyze a problem by looking it from many perspectives. I was able to learn about Android development, and have a broader view on mobile development (both Android and iOS).

I had chance to experience teamwork in a big group doing a big project. I made acquaintance with many colleagues, and learned a lot from them, since I'm more theoretical than practical. These relationships and knowledge will help me alot in my future career.
