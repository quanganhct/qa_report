\section{Projects}

Although I was new to Android at that time, infact, I had never touch Android before, but I still managed to convince my seniors to let me participate in company's projects. The first project was the small project, named \textbf{Pedro}, which served at the \textbf{Charle \& Keith Fasionable Awards 2015}. In this project I was able to study about the basic of Android development and some advanced technic.

The second one is a big project. This project is the digital version of Singapore government project, \textbf{Electronic Tourist Refund Scheme} aka \textbf{eTRS}. In this report I will concentrate on the technics, and knownledge which I was able to acquired.
