Mobile development is one of the most popular industries nowaday. Each year there are several hundreds millions of smartphones which were sold, in which Android devices and iOS devices hold the most part, around 98\% of the market. I decided to learn about Android development, since it used Java language, the most familiar programming language to me. For that reason I applied into a branch of Rainmaker Labs in Vietnam, a mobile development outsourcing company.
